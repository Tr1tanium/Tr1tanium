# Hey, I'm Tritanium!
I like all sorts of things, but here you'll mostly see goofy coding stuff I decided might be helpful to someone else at some point, and sometimes some physical stuff for arduino or relating to FPV. Below I've listed some of the stuff I do!
## Virtual Reality :3
I've been involved in VR since 2016-ish, finally buying my first real headset when the Oculus Quest 2 released. *(I had one of those terrible plastic google cardboard headsets before, but those absolutely do not count)* Now I own a Meta Quest 3, and a Valve Index as well! I'm still learning all about OpenVR and OpenXR systems, but eventually I'd like to make something that makes the Oculus Link less... what's the word... terrible.
## FPV Drones
Drones are cool, building stuff is cool, building drones is cool. Need I say more?
## Languages
Currently I know: Python, Lua, HTML, CSS, C#, C++, and Javascript!
